# Sales-Procurement-Dashboard
Cleaned and transformed raw sales and procurement data using MySQL, ensuring data quality across multiple Atliq Hardware retail outlets in India by correcting inconsistencies and errors.

Conducted comprehensive data analysis of yearly sales and purchases to uncover insights and trends.

Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs, store-level comparisons, and trends over time.

Used a free trial of Tableau Desktop to create the dashboard, but after the trial ended, I was only able to retain the PowerPoint presentation (PPT) that showcases the final visualizations and insights.
